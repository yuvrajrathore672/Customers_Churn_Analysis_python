# Customers_Churn_Analysis_python

Python Project--

-Performed end-to-end data analysis to identify key factors influencing customer churn using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
-Built and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) to predict churn with accuracy and precision.
-Extracted actionable insights: senior citizens, lack of tech support, and month-to-month billing significantly increase churn risk.
-Suggested data-driven strategies to improve customer retention through bundling and loyalty incentives.
